Web Development Fellowship @ Oasis Infobyte

This repository showcases the project I completed as part of my Web Development Fellowship at Oasis Infobyte. Each task reflects foundational concepts in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Task 3: Temperature Converter

Created an interactive temperature converter tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application enables users to convert temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, with real-time updates based on user input.

Highlights:

* Input validation for numerical values
* Selection of input/output units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
* Real-time conversion output
* Simple, intuitive, and responsive UI
